GH Pages Link: https://thinkful-ei-rabbit.github.io/malik-dejean-bookmarks-app/

Uses Thinkful's API to allow users to create custom bookmarks!

------------------------------User stories completed-----------------------------

User can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

title
url link
description
rating (1-5)
User can see a list of their bookmarks when they first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating-
User can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link-
User can remove bookmarks from their bookmark list

User receive appropriate feedback when they cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)-
User can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
